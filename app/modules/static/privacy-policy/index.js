        <p>Effective Date: June 25, 2018</p>

        <h3>1. Introduction</h3>
        <p>KangarooHealth, Inc. (“us,” “we,” or “KangarooHealth”) is committed to respecting the privacy rights of our customers, visitors, and other users of KangarooHealth.com (the “Site”) and related websites, applications, services and mobile applications provided by KangarooHealth and on/in which this Privacy Policy is posted or referenced (collectively, the “Services”). We created this Privacy Policy (“Privacy Policy”) to give you confidence as you use the Services and to demonstrate our commitment to the protection of privacy. This Privacy Policy is only applicable to the Services. This Privacy Policy does not apply to any other website or digital service that you may be able to access through the Services or any website or digital services of KangarooHealth’s business partners, each of which may have data collection, storage and use practices and policies that may differ from this Privacy Policy. Your use of the Services is governed by this Privacy Policy and the Agreement (as the term “Agreement” is defined in our Terms of Use). Any capitalized term used but not defined in this Privacy Policy shall have the meaning in the Agreement. BY USING THE SERVICES, YOU AGREE TO THE PRACTICES AND POLICIES OUTLINED IN THIS PRIVACY POLICY AND YOU HEREBY CONSENT TO THE COLLECTION, USE, AND SHARING OF YOUR INFORMATION AS DESCRIBED IN THIS PRIVACY POLICY. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE WITH THIS PRIVACY POLICY, YOU CANNOT USE THE SERVICES. IF YOU USE THE SERVICES ON BEHALF OF SOMEONE ELSE (SUCH AS YOUR CHILD) OR AN ENTITY (SUCH AS YOUR EMPLOYER), YOU REPRESENT THAT YOU ARE AUTHORIZED BY SUCH INDIVIDUAL OR ENTITY TO ACCEPT THIS PRIVACY POLICY ON SUCH INDIVIDUAL’S OR ENTITY’S BEHALF.</p>

        <h3>2. Information We Collect</h3>
        <h4>2.1 Personal Information Generally</h4>
        <p>Some of the Services require us to learn more about you so that we can best meet your needs. When you access the Services, we may ask you to voluntarily provide us certain information that personally identifies you or could be used to personally identify you (“Personal Information”). Personal Information includes (but is not limited to) the following categories of information: (1) contact data (such as your e-mail address and phone number); (2) demographic data (such as your gender, your date of birth and your zip code); (3) insurance data (such as your insurance carrier, insurance plan, member ID, group ID and payer ID); (4) medical data (such as the doctors, dentists or other healthcare specialists, professionals, providers, or organizations (collectively, “Healthcare Providers”) you have visited, your reasons for visit, your dates of visit, your medical history, and other medical and health information you choose to share with us); and (5) other identifying information that you voluntarily choose to provide to us, including without limitation unique identifiers such as passwords, and Personal Information in emails or letters that you send to us. We may also collect additional information, which may be Personal Information, as otherwise described to you at the point of collection or pursuant to your consent. You may still access and use some of the Services if you choose not to provide us with any Personal Information but features of the Services that require your Personal Information will not be accessible to you.</p>

        <h4>2.2 Billing, Collection and Payment Information</h4>
        <p>When you make a payment through our Services to a Healthcare Provider (as further described in and subject to other provisions of the Agreement), your payment card information is processed by our payment processing partner, such as Wepay (<a href="https://wepay.com" target="_blank">https://wepay.com</a>). Our payment processing partner collects your voluntarily provided payment card necessary to process your payment. Such partner’s use and storage of information it collects is governed by its applicable terms of service and privacy policy. The information we store includes your payment card type and the last four digits of the payment card.</p>
        <h4>2.3 Traffic Data</h4>
        <p>We also may automatically collect certain data when you use the Services, such as (1) IP address; (2) domain server; (3) type of device(s) used to access the Services; (4) web browser(s) used to access the Services; (5) referring webpage or other source through which you accessed the Services; (6) geolocation information; and (7) other statistics and information associated with the interaction between your browser or device and the Services (collectively “Trac Data”). Depending on applicable law, some Trac Data may be Personal Information.</p>
        <h4>2.4 HIPAA and PHI</h4>
        <p>Under a federal law called the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (“HIPAA”), some demographic, health and/or health-related information that KangarooHealth collects as part of providing the Services may be considered “protected health information” or “PHI.” Specifically, when KangarooHealth receives identifiable information about you from or on behalf of your Healthcare Providers, this information is considered PHI.</p>
        <p>HIPAA provides specific protections for the privacy and security of PHI and restricts how PHI is used and disclosed. KangarooHealth may only use and disclose your PHI in the ways permitted by your Healthcare Provider(s). In addition, you may be asked to e-sign the KangarooHealth authorization (the “KangarooHealth Authorization”). Your decision to e-sign the KangarooHealth Authorization is entirely voluntary. If you choose to e-sign the KangarooHealth Authorization, you agree that KangarooHealth may use and disclose your PHI in the same way it uses and discloses your Personal Information that is not PHI. These uses and disclosures are described in this Privacy Policy. To the extent any provision in the KangarooHealth Authorization is inconsistent with this Privacy Policy or other provisions of the Agreement, then the provision in the KangarooHealth Authorization only controls with respect to your PHI. If you do not e-sign the KangarooHealth Authorization, then your Personal Information that is not PHI is governed by this Privacy Policy and your Personal Information that is PHI is used and disclosed only as permitted by your Healthcare Provider(s).</p>

        <h3>3. How We Collect Information</h3>
        <p>We collect information (including Personal Information and Trac Data) when you use and interact with the Services, and in some cases from third party sources. Such means of collection include:</p>
        <p>When you use the Services’ interactive tools and services, such as searching for Healthcare Providers, searching for available appointments with Healthcare Providers and completing medical history forms (“Medical History Forms”) prior to Healthcare Provider appointments; When you voluntarily provide information in free-form text boxes through the Services or through responses to surveys, questionnaires and the like; If you download and install certain applications and software we make available, we may receive and collect information transmitted from your computing device for the purpose of providing you the relevant Services, such as information regarding when you are logged on and available to receive updates or alert notices; If you download our mobile application or use a location-enabled browser, we may receive information about your location and mobile device, as applicable; Through cookies, web beacons, website analytics services and other tracking technology (collectively, “Tracking Tools”), as described below; and When you use the “Contact Us” function on the Site, send us an email or otherwise contact us.</p>

        <h3>4. Tracking Tools and “Do Not Track”</h3>
        <h4>4.1. Tracking Tools</h4>
        <p>We may use tools outlined below in order to provide our Services to, advertise to, and to better understand users.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>Cookies: “Cookies” are small computer les transferred to your computing device that contain information such as user ID, user preferences, lists of pages visited and activities conducted while using the Services. We use Cookies to improve or tailor the Services or customize advertisements by tracking navigation habits, measuring performance, storing authentication status so re-entering credentials is not required, customizing user experiences with the Services and for analytics and fraud prevention.</p>
            <p>For more information on cookies, visit <a href="http://www.allaboutcookies.org." target="_blank">http://www.allaboutcookies.org.</a></p>
          </li>
          <li>Web Beacons: “Web Beacons” (a.k.a. clear GIFs or pixel tags) are tiny graphic image les embedded in a web page or email that may be used to collect information about the use of our Services, the websites of selected advertisers and the emails, special promotions or newsletters that we send. The information collected by Web Beacons allows us to analyze how many people are using the Services, using selected publishers’ websites or opening emails, and for what purpose, and also allows us to enhance our interest-based advertising (discussed further below).</li>
          <li>Website Analytics: We may use third-party website analytics services in connection with the Services, including, for example, to register mouse clicks, mouse movements, scrolling activity and text typed into the Site. We use the information collected from these services to help make the Services easier to use and as otherwise set forth in Section 5 (Use of Information). These website analytics services generally do not collect Personal Information unless you voluntarily provide it and generally do not track your browsing habits across websites that do not use their services.</li>
          <li>Mobile Device Identifiers: As with other Tracking Tools, mobile device identifiers help KangarooHealth learn more about our users’ demographics and internet behaviors. Mobile device identifiers are data stored on mobile devices that may track mobile device and data and activities occurring on and through it, as well as the applications installed on it. Mobile device identifiers enable collection of Personal Information (such as media access control, address and location) and Trac Data.</li>
          <li>Cross Device Matching: To determine if users have interacted with content across multiple devices and to match such devices, we may work with partners who analyze device activity data and/or rely on your information (including demographic, geographic and interest-based data). To supplement this analysis, we may also provide de-identified data these partners. Based on this data, we may then display targeted advertisements across devices that we believe are associated or use this data to further analyze usage of Services across devices.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>4.2. Tracking Tools</h4>
        <p>We may use a type of advertising commonly known as interest-based or online behavioral advertising. This means that some of our partners use Tracking Tools to display KangarooHealth ads on other websites or services based on information about your use of the Services or your interests (as inferred from online activity). Such partners may include third-party service providers, advertisers, advertising networks or platforms, and agencies. Other Tracking Tools used by our partners may collect information when you use the Services, such as IP address, mobile device ID, operating system, browser, web page interactions, geographic location and demographic information, such as gender and age range. These Tracking Tools help KangarooHealth learn more about our users’ demographics and internet behaviors.</p>
        <h4>4.3. Options for Opting out of Cookies and Mobile Device Identifiers</h4>
        <p>Some web browsers (including some mobile web browsers) allow you to reject Cookies or to alert you when a Cookie is placed on your computer, tablet or mobile device. You may be able to reject mobile device identifiers by activating the appropriate setting on your mobile device. Although you are not required to accept KangarooHealth’s Cookies or mobile device identifiers, if you block or reject them, you may not have access to all features available through the Services.</p>
        <p>You may opt out of receiving certain Cookies and certain trackers by visiting the Network Advertising Initiative (NAI) opt out page or the Digital Advertising Alliance (DAA) consumer opt-out page, or by installing the DAA’s AppChoice app (for iOS; for Android) on your mobile computing device. When you use these opt-out features, an “opt-out” Cookie will be placed on your computer, tablet or mobile computing device indicating that you do not want to receive interest-based advertising from NAI or DAA member companies. If you delete Cookies on your computer, tablet or mobile computing device, you may need to opt out again. For information about how to opt out of interest-based advertising on mobile devices, please visit <a href="http://www.applicationprivacy.org/expressing-your-behavioral-advertisingchoices-on-a-mobile-device" target="_blank">http://www.applicationprivacy.org/expressing-your-behavioral-advertisingchoices-on-a-mobile-device</a>. You will need to opt out of each browser and device for which you desire to apply these opt-out features.</p>
        <p>Please note that even after opting out of interest-based advertising, you may still see KangarooHealth advertisements that are not interest-based (i.e., not targeted toward you). Also, opting out does not mean that KangarooHealth is no longer using Tracking Tools — KangarooHealth still may collect information about your use of the Services even after you have opted out of interest-based advertisements and may still serve advertisements to you via the Services based on information it collects via the Services.</p>
        <h4>4.4. How KangarooHealth Responds to Browser “Do Not Track” (DNT) Signals</h4>
        <p> Some web browsers (including Safari, Internet Explorer, Firefox and Chrome) incorporate a “Do Not Track” (DNT) or similar feature that signals to websites that a visitor does not want to have his/her online activity and behavior tracked. If a website operator elects to respond to a particular DNT signal, the website operator may refrain from collecting certain Personal Information about the browser’s user. Not all browsers oer a DNT option and there is currently no industry consensus as to what constitutes a DNT signal. For these reasons, many website operators, including KangarooHealth, do not proactively respond to DNT signals. For more information about DNT signals, visit <a href="http://allaboutdnt.com" target="_blank">http://allaboutdnt.com</a>.</p>

        <h3>5. Use of Information</h3>
        <p>We may use information that is neither Personal Information nor PHI (including non-PHI Personal Information that has been de-identified and/or aggregated) to better understand who uses KangarooHealth and how we can deliver a better healthcare experience (for example, testing different kinds of emails has helped us understand when and how patients prefer to get Wellness Reminders for preventive care), or otherwise at our discretion.</p>
        <p>We use information, including Personal Information, to provide the Services and to help improve the Services, to develop new services, and to advertise (for example, to display KangarooHealth ads on other websites). Such use may include:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>We may share your Personal Information with Healthcare Providers with whom you choose to schedule through the Services.

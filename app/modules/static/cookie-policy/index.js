        <h3>1. Introduction</h3>
        <p>When you use the KangarooHealth websites (“Site”) or mobile application (“App”) certain information about your equipment, browsing actions, and patterns may be collected by KangarooHealth using cookies, web beacons, and other tracking technologies.

        <h3>2. What are cookies and web beacons?</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Cookies are small text files that can be placed on your computer or mobile device that uniquely (but anonymously) identify your browser or device. A cookie contains a unique number, which is used to recognize your computer or mobile device when you return to our website, and remember your preferences and actions. Cookies cannot search your computer in any way or introduce viruses.</li>
          <li>Web beacons (also referred to as clear gifs, pixel tags, and single-pixel gifs) are small electronic files contained on pages of websites that permit companies to count users who have visited certain webpages on a website or mobile application and are used for other related statistics and analytics (e.g., recording the popularity of certain website content and verifying system and server integrity).</li>
        </ul>

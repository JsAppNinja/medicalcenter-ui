        <h3>4. AUTHORIZATION AND ACKNOWLEDGEMENT; IMPORTANT INFORMATION </h3>
        <p>ABOUT HEALTHCARE PROVIDER RELATIONSHIPS AND HEALTHCARE PROVIDER LISTS In connection with using the Site and the Services to locate and schedule appointments with Healthcare Providers, you understand that: YOU ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR CHOOSING YOUR OWN HEALTHCARE PROVIDER.</p>
        <p>KangarooHealth makes reasonable efforts to ensure that Healthcare Providers only participate in the Services if they hold all active licenses required by law to practice the specialties of the services offered by them and are not excluded from participation in the Medicare and Medicaid programs. KangarooHealth may exclude Healthcare Providers who, in KangarooHealth’s discretion, have engaged in inappropriate or unprofessional conduct.</p>
        <p>Some Healthcare Providers listed through the Services enter into contracts with us and may pay us a fee in order to be marketed through or to use the Services. To help you and Healthcare Providers who may be suitable for your needs and enable the maximum choice and diversity of Healthcare Providers participating in the Services, we will provide you with lists and/or proles of Healthcare Providers. These results are based on information that you provide to us, such as insurance information, geographical location, and healthcare specialty. They may also be based on other criteria (including, for example, Healthcare Provider availability, past selections by and/or ratings of Healthcare Providers by you or by other KangarooHealth users, and past experience of KangarooHealth users with Healthcare Providers). Note that KangarooHealth (a) does not recommend or endorse any Healthcare Providers, (b) does not make any representations or warranties with respect to these Healthcare Providers or the quality of the healthcare services they may provide, and (c) does not receive any additional fees from Healthcare Providers for featuring them (i.e., higher or better placement on lists) through the Services (subject to Sponsored Results as described below). Note, however, to the extent that you use the Services as provided by your employer, KangarooHealth may provide lists and/or prole previews based also on criteria determined by your employer and your employer’s agents or advisors.</p>
        <p>We may show you advertisements or sponsored results (“Sponsored Results”) on the Site, including above the search results. KangarooHealth receives additional fees from Healthcare Providers for providing Sponsored Results. Sponsored Results shown through the Services are not, and should not be considered, an endorsement or recommendation by KangarooHealth of the Healthcare Provider.</p>

        <p>The insurance and insurance related Content (including, without limitation, insurance coverage and benefit Content) (“Insurance Content”) may be intended for general reference purposes and for your convenience only. Such Insurance Content may be based on Personal Information (as defined below) you provide to us as well as Healthcare Provider Content (such as CPT codes and other encounter data). The Insurance Content is provided either directly by the insurance provider you identify or via a third-party clearinghouse. Insurance Content can change frequently and may become out of date, incomplete or inaccurate. To make this Content as accurate as possible, you agree that you will (a) provide accurate and complete insurance-related Personal Information, and (b) verify and update your insurance-related Personal Information (including, without limitation, verifying such Personal Information obtained by automated means from an insurance card you provide).

        <p>We hope that we can work out any disagreements you might have with KangarooHealth.

If any part of this Agreement is held invalid or unenforceable, that portion shall be construed in a manner consistent with applicable law to reflect, as nearly as possible, the original intentions of the parties, and the remaining portions shall remain in full force and effect. The failure of KangarooHealth to exercise or enforce any right or provision of this Agreement shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision.</p>
        <p>The failure of either party to exercise in any respect any right provided for herein shall not be deemed a waiver of any further rights hereunder.</p>
        <h4>16.6 Headings</h4>
